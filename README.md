# Sound Cloud Song Downloader

Basically made this cause I wanted to listen to American Wedding by Frank Ocean and couldnt find it on spotify.
So here we are...

This is a A python script that downloads any public SoundCloud track directly to your computer using scdl, with automatic extraction of the required client_id.

**Features**

- Automatically extracts the current SoundCloud client_id.
- Downloads any public track via scdl.
- Works cross-platform (tested on Windows).

# Requirements

- **Make sure to install scdl**

'     Use "pip install scdl" to install scdl on your local device.'

- **ffmpeg**

'     <a href="https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/"> Click Here</a> to install ffmpeg if the code executes with error showing "ffmpeg not found".'

'     You might have to set up the system PATH environment variable. Install the package from the given link and after unzipping the file copy the path of the bin folder and add it to path.'

'     **Recomended to run on Collab if you avoid this installation.**'

# Downloaded files

If running the script locally, the song will be downloaded into the folder where your .py file is located.
